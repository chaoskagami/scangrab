No longer supported
 * Fakku - Deleted after the purge. If anyone wants it back, they'll need to buy me a membership so I can test.
 * Batoto - Requires javascript interpretation. Also requires broken content security policies and potentially chrome. Doesn't work on palemoon, and may require an account now. Went from 'best' to 'unusable piece of shit.' The module will remain in the batoto branch and likely rot.
