tl;dr NOT HAPPENING, EVER.

Long: No, I will not add a scraper for them. If you want it, do it yourself. It won't even be accepted as PR. Here's why:

 * They rip off translators without giving proper credit.

 * They upload official, copyrighted translations with incorrect attribution and don't properly respond to DMCA.

 * Everything is a 75%-Q jpeg, in other words... absolute crap quality.

 * Every image has a gigantic uncorrectible watermark at the bottom.
