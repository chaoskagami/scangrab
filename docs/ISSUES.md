Actual issues
----------------

 * Batoto is close to KIA because of the new layout which is 100% AJAX. I'll try to fix up eventually but no guarantees about speediness. The current method is a terrible hack.

 * The upgrader has some rather negative quirks. These need resolving. One of the things that needs to go is the 'rev' file.
