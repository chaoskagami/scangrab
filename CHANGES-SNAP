This file describes the changes made in the release snapshots. When parsing with scangrab, this line is skipped.
== START ==
 * Fix for FAT filesystems. No more errors for '<' and '>'.
   I'd like to detect this, though...
 * Another fix for an anomaly I found on E-h. Tabs and Newlines in
   filenames are NOT kosher.
 * Frontend overhaul. Syntax changes. Run 'scangrab -h' to see info.
 * Minor fix for mangabox.
== END ==
Older commit messages are moved down here.

 * Fixed double filename bug. No more Suika Suika\nSuika Suika nonsense!
 * Work made on a fancy-pants bash fetcher for if a stupid device is used
   but said device has access to bash sockets. See functions/bash_get.
 * This script now is set +H. Shell history was causing issues.
 * Added a readable changelog for upgrades. That is, this file.
