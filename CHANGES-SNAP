This file describes the changes made in the release snapshots. When parsing with scangrab, this line is skipped.
== START ==
 * Bugfix for E-h login. I was doing it over an insecure http connection.
   Sorry.
 * Handling the login option improperly is now fixed.
 * Repeated failures to get images don't leave htmls in the zip. I hope.
 * Add a format option. Now you can specify -fFORMAT to get zip, 7z, etc
== END ==
Older commit messages are moved down here.

 * Fix for FAT filesystems. No more errors for '<' and '>'.
   I'd like to detect this, though...
 * Another fix for an anomaly I found on E-h. Tabs and Newlines in
   filenames are NOT kosher.
 * Frontend overhaul. Syntax changes. Run 'scangrab -h' to see info.
 * Minor fix for mangabox.
 * Handle the 'Filename too long' situation that sometimes happens due
   to overnaming on E-H. Seriously, though, why do they do that?
 * Fixed double filename bug. No more Suika Suika\nSuika Suika nonsense!
 * Work made on a fancy-pants bash fetcher for if a stupid device is used
   but said device has access to bash sockets. See functions/bash_get.
 * This script now is set +H. Shell history was causing issues.
 * Added a readable changelog for upgrades. That is, this file.
