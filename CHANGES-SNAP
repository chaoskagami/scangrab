This file describes the changes made in the release snapshots. When parsing with scangrab, this line is skipped.
== START ==
 * Began working on a way to download batoto again, since they broke
   everything by disabling the old static pages. Not fully implemented
   yet, more specifically the scraper. Unfortunately, you now need
   firefox, palemoon, or xulrunner to have batoto work (may change)
 * Fixed annoying danbooru issue where IDs glitch out when parsing
   a pixiv animation; turns out I have to filter them.
 * Miscellaneous issues.
 * Proper console command syntax.
 * I'm going to start making stables. We're far enough along.
   They'll be dated like youtube-dl.
== END ==
Older commit messages are moved down here.

 * Bugfix for E-h login. I was doing it over an insecure http connection.
   Sorry.
 * Handling the login option improperly is now fixed.
 * Repeated failures to get images don't leave htmls in the zip. I hope.
 * Add a format option. Now you can specify -fFORMAT to get zip, 7z, etc
 * Added support for Imgur galleries (because of the 'give us your email'
   bullshit. Now I can actuallu download the weekly touhou doujins.
 * Fix for FAT filesystems. No more errors for '<' and '>'.
   I'd like to detect this, though...
 * Another fix for an anomaly I found on E-h. Tabs and Newlines in
   filenames are NOT kosher.
 * Frontend overhaul. Syntax changes. Run 'scangrab -h' to see info.
 * Minor fix for mangabox.
 * Handle the 'Filename too long' situation that sometimes happens due
   to overnaming on E-H. Seriously, though, why do they do that?
 * Fixed double filename bug. No more Suika Suika\nSuika Suika nonsense!
 * Work made on a fancy-pants bash fetcher for if a stupid device is used
   but said device has access to bash sockets. See functions/bash_get.
 * This script now is set +H. Shell history was causing issues.
 * Added a readable changelog for upgrades. That is, this file.
