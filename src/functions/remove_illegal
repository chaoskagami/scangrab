# These are characters that are either issue causing or
# not FAT-legal.

# Forward slash is not legal on linux.
# Pipe character isn't legal on FAT and can cause issues with redirection.
# ? is not FAT legal, so it is replaced with the unicode wide version
# Angle brackets are not FAT legal - they're replaced with parenthesis.
# \t is a no-no in filenames. I've seen at least one instance of this nastiness.
# \n - see \t.
